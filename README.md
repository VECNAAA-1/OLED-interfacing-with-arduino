# OLED-interfacing-with-arduino

This repository contains a simple Arduino/PlatformIO example that demonstrates
initializing and writing to an Adafruit SSD1306 OLED display over I2C.

## Generating documentation with Doxygen

A minimal `Doxyfile` is included. To generate HTML documentation locally, run:

```powershell
# Install Doxygen if not already installed, then from the repo root:
doxygen Doxyfile
```

Generated HTML will be placed in the `docs/html` directory.
